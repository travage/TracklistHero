# TracklistHero
[1001Tracklists](https://www.1001tracklists.com/) is a popular website in the electronic music community that contains thousands of tracklists (i.e. what songs are played and in what order) for DJ sets and mixes, all available for free. This comes in handy for someone that hears a song in a DJ's set that they really take a liking to, but they don't know the name of the song, who created it, etc. In that case, a user can go to 1001Tracklists, search for the DJ set, and locate what the song is at the time it was playing. Often, the tracklists are directly linked to the YouTube video of the DJ set so the songs will have corresponding time stamps. Where this differs from a platform like Shazam is that 1001Tracklists will include remixes, unreleased songs, edits, and other music that is unlikely to be on Shazam.

The goal of **TracklistHero** is to be a web extension that displays the tracklist, courtesey of 1001Tracklists, of a DJ set that is being listened to within a web browser, without having to open a new tab or window, thus making it faster and easier to locate that mystery song. The biggest goal would be for **TracklistHero** to automatically pull up the tracklist with little-to-no user direction, but one step at a time. :smile:
